A RecyclerView that can switch between items and placeholders.  
This libs doesn't force a placehoder type, the developer is responsible for creating one, checkout the sample module and see how simple it is.  

You can use the best beloved [Shimmer-Android](http://facebook.github.io/shimmer-android/), a [Lottie](https://airbnb.design/lottie/) animation or even [Property Animation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/animation-resource). Use your imagination, it's your placeholder ðŸ˜Š

## Getting started

The first step is to include PlaceHolderRecyclerView into your project, for example, as a Gradle compile dependency:

```groovy

```
```java
class MyItemsPlaceHolderAdapter : ..., PlaceHolderAdapter { ...}
...

private val itemsAdapter = MyItemsAdapter()
...
with(binding.myRecyclerView) {
    adapter = itemsAdapter
    holdersAdapter = MyItemsPlaceHolderAdapter()
}
...
viewModel.items.observe(this, Observer { itemsAdapter.update(it) })
viewModel.isLoading.observe(this, Observer { isLoading -> binding.myRecyclerView.toggleHoldersAdapter(isLoading) })
